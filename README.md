# Log4j Scanner #

This repository provides a scanning solution for the log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046). 
The information and code in this repository is provided "as is" and was assembled with the help of the open-source community and updated by CISA through collaboration with the broader cybersecurity community.

## CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046 ##

### Steps to test ###

<details><summary>Configure your own DNS Server - Preferred) </summary><br/>
- Add DNS records to your domain. (example.com)

- `A` record with a value of your IP address (`test.example.com` -> <PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>)
- `NS` record (`ns1.example.com`) with a value of the `test.example.com` as chosen above.

- Host a DNS server to log DNS requests made to your domain. 

- Install the requirement modules -> `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- Modify the `dns/ddnsserver.py` script with the value of the NS record above (`test.example.com`) 

- `python3 dns/ddnsserver.py --udp 53 >> dns-results.txt`

- Test it with `nslookup hello.test.example.com`. You can run `tail -f dns-results.txt` to monitor these logs. 

- You should see the entry in your `dns-results.txt` file after the `nslookup` command. Once you do, you're ready to scan! 

- Note: Same concepts will apply if you're using internal DNS to test this. 

</details>

<details><summary>DNS providers - (Interact.sh or canarytokens.org) </summary><br/>

- [Interact.sh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh)  - Interactsh is an open-source solution for out-of-band data extraction. It is a tool designed to detect bugs that cause external interactions. These bugs include, Blind SQLi, Blind CMDi, SSRF, etc. 

- [Canarytokens.org](https://canarytokens.org/generate) - Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on your network.

</details>

<details><summary>LDAP Server (OPTIONAL)</summary><br/>

- Reference the `README.md` under the `ldap` directory if you'd also like to test a running LDAP server.

- Build the project using maven. `cd ldap`

- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`

- `nohup java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://127.0.0.1:8080/#payload" 443 >> ldap_requests.txt &`

- There are [alternatives](https://github.com/alexandre-lavoie/python-log4rce) to this project as well. 
</details>

<details><summary>HTTP Service Discovery & Scanning</summary><br/>

- Gather your most update-to-date asset list of your organization and find web services. Though this vulnerability does not solely affect web services, 
this will serve as a great starting point to minimizing the attack surface.

- **If you have a list of company owned URLS, you may skip this step**: Utilize some well known tools like [httpprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) or [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) to identify web services running on multiple ports. Basic Example: `httpprobe` -> `cat list-of-your-company-domains.txt | $HOME/go/bin/httprobe > your-web-assets.txt`

- Now that you have a list of URLs, you're ready to scan: `python3 log4j-scan.py --run-all-tests --custom-dns-callback-host test.example.com -l web-asset-urls.txt`

- Be sure to scan for the **new** CVE as well -> `python3 log4j-scan.py --test-CVE-2021-45046 --custom-dns-callback-host test.example.com -l web-asset-urls.txt`

- Monitor the DNS server configured in **Step 2**.

## CREDITS ##

As many in industry, we did not feel the need to "re-invent the wheel". This
recommended scanning solution is derived from the great work of others (with slight modifications). We've included two additional
projects to avoid using third-parties.

[log4j-scan](https://github.com/fullhunt/log4j-scan) - Log4j vulnerability scanning framework. **Thank you to the fullhunt.io team.**

[dns](https://gist.github.com/pklaus/b5a7876d4d2cf7271873) - Simple DNS server (UDP and TCP) in Python. **Thank you pklaus & andreif.**

[ldap](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) - Contains useful code to test the lookup() call. **Thank you mbechler**

## Disclaimers ##

- There are likely additional, as yet unknown ways to leverage these (**CVE-2021-44228** & **CVE-2021-45046**) vulnerabilities. CISA is staying vigilant across
multiple platforms (blog posts, repos, tweets, etc.) to stay up-to-date as the log4j situation unfolds and progresses.

- This repository will focus solely on providing tooling to help organizations look for a limited set of currently known vulnerabilities in assets owned by their organization.
